# DSA Log : What did I learn?

---

This is me just trying to log what did I learn everyday and me just trying to stay consistent at learning DSA.

I do not want to do this everyday because my work and study won't allow space for it everyday but I want to log in atleast a line every few days regularly.

## **Day1**

Date : 10/02/2025

Let me just start following this tutorial on w3 schools. I feel like following this because I believe it has got good resources, is simple to follow. It is in Python and C but I am trying to do this in CPP so I think it will have sufficient help and friction to keep me motivated.

### What I learnt today?

I am trying to solve this fibonacci series problem. I had done this before but doing it after some time.

- I declared count inside the function which made the loop infinite. I should have decalred it outside.
- Getting started with the basics on what an algorithm is.
- Next day will be about arrays.
